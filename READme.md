# A simple page that calculates the BMI of a person
## Introduction
Hello! This is one of my first projects with RocketSeat. This is a page that receives
the data about a person and calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI).

## Composition
This project is composed of three files. One HTML file (.html) to make the main page structure, another
CSS (.css) to style the page and a JavaScript (.js) file to add the calculus and the functionality to the page.

## Developing
To develop it, there is no secret! Just download or clone it and start coding!

## Using the page
To use it, guess what! There is no secret too! Just download the repository and access the bmi.html file.
